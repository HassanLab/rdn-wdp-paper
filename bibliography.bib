	Abstract = {Seven strains of West nile virus isolated in Nigeria were investigated for their ability to form plaques in monkey kidney cell monolayers. Five strains antigenically related to one another produced plaques of about the same size 3 to 4 days after the addition of the overlay medium. The two other strains closely related to each other produced no plaques. Their inability to produce plaques was regarded as a significant characteristic of the intratypic group to which the two strains belong.},

@article{Halder:1995aa,
	Abstract = {The Drosophila gene eyeless (ey) encodes a transcription factor with both a paired domain and a homeodomain. It is homologous to the mouse Small eye (Pax-6) gene and to the Aniridia gene in humans. These genes share extensive sequence identity, the position of three intron splice sites is conserved, and these genes are expressed similarly in the developing nervous system and in the eye during morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in both the insect and in the mammalian genes have been shown to lead to a reduction or absence of eye structures, which suggests that ey functions in eye morphogenesis. By targeted expression of the ey complementary DNA in various imaginal disc primordia of Drosophila, ectopic eye structures were induced on the wings, the legs, and on the antennae. The ectopic eyes appeared morphologically normal and consisted of groups of fully differentiated ommatidia with a complete set of photoreceptor cells. These results support the proposition that ey is the master control gene for eye morphogenesis. Because homologous genes are present in vertebrates, ascidians, insects, cephalopods, and nemerteans, ey may function as a master control gene throughout the metazoa.},

	Abstract = {A Drosophila gene that contains both a paired box and a homeobox and has extensive sequence homology to the mouse Pax-6 (Small eye) gene was isolated and mapped to chromosome IV in a region close to the eyeless locus. Two spontaneous mutations, ey2 and eyR, contain transposable element insertions into the cloned gene and affect gene expression, particularly in the eye primordia. This indicates that the cloned gene encodes ey. The finding that ey of Drosophila, Small eye of the mouse, and human Aniridia are encoded by homologous genes suggests that eye morphogenesis is under similar genetic control in both vertebrates and insects, in spite of the large differences in eye morphology and mode of development.},

@article{Dong:2002aa,
	Abstract = {The Drosophila antenna is a highly derived appendage required for a variety of sensory functions including olfaction and audition. To investigate how this complex structure is patterned, we examine the specific functions of genes required for antenna development. The nuclear factors, Homothorax, Distal-less and Spineless, are each required for particular aspects of antennal fate. Coexpression of Homothorax, necessary for nuclear localization of its ubiquitously expressed partner Extradenticle, with Distal-less is required to establish antenna fate. Here we test which antenna patterning genes are targets of Homothorax, Distal-less and/or Spineless. We report that the antennal expression of dachshund, atonal, spalt, and cut requires Homothorax and/or Distal-less, but not Spineless. We conclude that Distal-less and Homothorax specify antenna fates via regulation of multiple genes. We also report for the first time phenotypic consequences of losing either dachshund or spalt and spalt-related from the antenna. We find that dachshund and spalt/spalt-related are essential for proper joint formation between particular antennal segments. Furthermore, the spalt/spalt-related null antennae are defective in hearing. Hearing defects are also associated with the human diseases Split Hand/Split Foot Malformation and Townes-Brocks Syndrome, which are linked to human homologs of Distal-less and spalt, respectively. We therefore propose that there are significant genetic similarities between the auditory organs of humans and flies.},

@article{Jarman:1993aa,
	Abstract = {In the Drosophila peripheral nervous system, proneural genes of the achaete-scute complex (ASC) are required for formation of the precursors of external sense organs but not of chordotonal organs. We report the isolation of a gene, atonal (ato), with evidence that it is a proneural gene for the formation of chordotonal organs. This gene is expressed in the proneural clusters and sense organ precursors that give rise to the embryonic and adult chordotonal, but not external sense, organs. Chordotonal organs are eliminated in embryos carrying chromosomal deficiencies that remove ato. Like the ASC products, ato protein contains a basic-helix-loop-helix region and heterodimerizes with daughterless protein to bind to E boxes. Moreover, ectopic expression of ato promotes the formation of extra sense organs. Despite similar proneural properties, we find that ectopic expression of the ASC genes promotes external sense organ formation exclusively, whereas ato promotes chordotonal organ formation preferentially. Thus, proneural genes are major determinants of neuronal identity.},

@article{Jarman:1994aa,
	Abstract = {The Drosophila peripheral nervous system comprises four major types of sensory element: external sense organs (such as mechano-sensory bristles), chordotonal organs (internal stretch receptors), multiple dendritic neurons, and photoreceptors. During development, the selection of neural precursors for external sense organs requires the proneural genes of the achaete-scute complex, which encode basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors. These genes do not, however, control precursor selection for chordotonal organs or photoreceptors, raising the question of whether other proneural genes exist or a different mechanism of neurogenesis operates. Here we show that atonal (ato), originally isolated as a proneural gene for chordotonal organs, is also the proneural gene for photoreceptors. Pattern formation in the Drosophila eye involves a succession of cell fate specifications. Of the eight photoreceptors within each ommatidium of the compound eye, the photoreceptor R8 is the first to appear in the eye imaginal disc, right behind the morphogenetic furrow. The appearance of other photoreceptors (R1-7) follows in a defined sequence that is thought to arise by induction from R8 (refs 8, 9, 11, 12). We find that photoreceptor formation requires the function of atonal at the morphogenetic furrow and that atonal is specifically required for R8 selection. Formation of other photoreceptors does not directly require atonal function, but does depend on R8 selection by atonal. Thus, photoreceptors are selected by two mechanisms: R8 by a proneural mechanism, and R1-7 by local recruitment.},

@article{Aerts:2010aa,
	Abstract = {A comprehensive systems-level understanding of developmental programs requires the mapping of the underlying gene regulatory networks. While significant progress has been made in mapping a few such networks, almost all gene regulatory networks underlying cell-fate specification remain unknown and their discovery is significantly hampered by the paucity of generalized, in vivo validated tools of target gene and functional enhancer discovery. We combined genetic transcriptome perturbations and comprehensive computational analyses to identify a large cohort of target genes of the proneural and tumor suppressor factor Atonal, which specifies the switch from undifferentiated pluripotent cells to R8 photoreceptor neurons during larval development. Extensive in vivo validations of the predicted targets for the proneural factor Atonal demonstrate a 50\% success rate of bona fide targets. Furthermore we show that these enhancers are functionally conserved by cloning orthologous enhancers from Drosophila ananassae and D. virilis in D. melanogaster. Finally, to investigate cis-regulatory cross-talk between Ato and other retinal differentiation transcription factors (TFs), we performed motif analyses and independent target predictions for Eyeless, Senseless, Suppressor of Hairless, Rough, and Glass. Our analyses show that cisTargetX identifies the correct motif from a set of coexpressed genes and accurately predicts target genes of individual TFs. The validated set of novel Ato targets exhibit functional enrichment of signaling molecules and a subset is predicted to be coregulated by other TFs within the retinal gene regulatory network.},

@article{Pepple:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Patterning of sensory organs requires precise regulation of neural induction and repression. The neurocrystalline pattern of the adult Drosophila compound eye is generated by ordered selection of single founder photoreceptors (R8s) for each unit eye or ommatidium. R8 selection requires mechanisms that restrict R8 potential to a single cell from within a group of cells expressing the proneural gene atonal (ato). One model of R8 selection suggests that R8 precursors are selected from a three-cell ;R8 equivalence group' through repression of ato by the homeodomain transcription factor Rough (Ro). A second model proposes that lateral inhibition is sufficient to select a single R8 from an equipotent group of cells called the intermediate group (IG). Here, we provide new evidence that lateral inhibition, but not ro, is required for the initial selection of a single R8 precursor. We show that in ro mutants, ectopic R8s develop from R2,5 photoreceptor precursors independently of ectopic Ato and hours after normal R8s are specified. We also show that Ro directly represses the R8 specific zinc-finger transcription factor senseless (sens) in the developing R2,5 precursors to block ectopic R8 differentiation. Our results support a new model for R8 selection in which lateral inhibition establishes a transient pattern of selected R8s that is permanently reinforced by a repressive bistable loop between sens and ro. This model provides new insight into the strategies that allow successful integration of a repressive patterning signal, such as lateral inhibition, with continued developmental plasticity during retinal differentiation.},

	Abstract = {The field of regulatory genomics today is characterized by the generation of high-throughput data sets that capture genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding, histone modifications, or DNAseI hypersensitive regions across many cell types and conditions. In this context, a critical question is how to make optimal use of these publicly available datasets when studying transcriptional regulation. Here, we address this question in Drosophila melanogaster for which a large number of high-throughput regulatory datasets are available. We developed i-cisTarget (where the 'i' stands for integrative), for the first time enabling the discovery of different types of enriched 'regulatory features' in a set of co-regulated sequences in one analysis, being either TF motifs or 'in vivo' chromatin features, or combinations thereof. We have validated our approach on 15 co-expressed gene sets, 21 ChIP data sets, 628 curated gene sets and multiple individual case studies, and show that meaningful regulatory features can be confidently discovered; that bona fide enhancers can be identified, both by in vivo events and by TF motifs; and that combinations of in vivo events and TF motifs further increase the performance of enhancer prediction.},

Generating mouse conditional knock-outs (cKO), where a gene can be eliminated in a temporally and spatially controlled manner, is a valuable technique because it allows study of gene function at any stage of life. In contrast and despite the development of many other powerful genetic tools, cKO has thus far been lacking in Drosophila. We combined several recent molecular and genetic technical advances in an approach termed integrase-mediated approach for gene knock-out (IMAGO). IMAGO allows the replacement of any genomic sequence, such as a gene, with another desired sequence, including cKO alleles that can be used to create positively marked mutant cells. IMAGO should also be applicable to other genetic model organisms.},

@article{Maul:1977aa,
	Abstract = {The number of pore complexes per nucleus was determined for a wide variety of cultured cells selected for their variable DNA content over a range of 1-5,6000. The pore number was compared to DNA content, nuclear surface area, and nuclear volume. Values for pore frequency (pores/square micrometer) were relatively constant in the species studied. When the pore to DNA ratio was plotted against the DNA content, there was a remarkable correlation which decreased exponentially for the cells of vertebrae origin. Exceptions were the heteroploid mammalian cells which had the same ratio as the diploid mammalian cells despite higher DNA content. The results are interpreted to mean that neither the nuclear surface, the nuclear volume, nor the DNA content alone determines the pore number of the nucleus, but rather an as yet undetermined combination of different factors. The surface and volume of vertebrate nuclei do not decrease with decreasing DNA content below a given value. The following speculation is suggested to account for the anomalous size changes of the nucleus relative to DNA content in vertebrates. Species with small DNA complements have a relatively large proportion of active chromatin which determines the limits of the physical parameters of the nucleus. The amount of active chromatin maybe the same for at least the vertebrates with low DNA content, At high DNA content, the nuclear parameters may be determined by the relatively high proportion of inactive condensed chromatin which increases the nuclear surface and volume.},

	Abstract = {Since the discovery of a single white eyed male in a population of red eyed flies over 100 years ago (), the compound eye of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been a favorite experimental system for identifying genes that regulate various aspects of development. For example, a fair amount of what we know today about enzymatic pathways and vesicular transport is due to the discovery and subsequent characterization of eye color mutants such as white. Likewise, our present day understanding of organogenesis has been aided considerably by studies of mutations, such as eyeless, that either reduce or eliminate the compound eyes. But by far the phenotype that has provided levers into the greatest number of experimental fields has been the humble ``rough'' eye. The fly eye is comprised of several hundred unit-eyes that are also called ommatidia. These unit eyes are packed into a hexagonal array of remarkable precision. The structure of the eye is so precise that it has been compared to that of a crystal (). Even the slightest perturbations to the structure of the ommatidium can be visually detected by light or electron microscopy. The cause for this is two-fold: (1) any defect that affects the hexagonal geometry of a single ommatidium can and will disrupt the positioning of surrounding unit eyes thereby propagating structural flaws and (2) disruptions in genes that govern the development of even a single cell within an ommatidium will affect all unit eyes. In both cases the effect is the visual magnification of even the smallest imperfection. Studies of rough eye mutants have provided key insights into the areas of cell fate specification, lateral inhibition, signal transduction, transcription factor networks, planar cell polarity, cell proliferation and programmed cell death just to name a few. This review will attempt to summarize the key steps that are required to assemble each ommatidium.},

The Drosophila gene atonal encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein similar to those encoded by the proneural genes of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C). The AS-C are required in the Drosophila PNS for the selection of neural precursors of external sense organs. We have isolated mutants of atonal, which reveal that this gene encodes the proneural gene for chordotonal organs and photoreceptors. In atonal mutants, all observable adult chordotonal organs, and almost all embryonic chordotonal organs fail to form; all adult photoreceptors are missing. For both types of sense organ, this defect is already apparent at the level of precursor formation. Therefore it is a failure in the epidermal-neural decision process i.e. a proneural defect. The failure to form photoreceptors results in atrophy of the atonal mutant imaginal disc, due to apoptosis and lack of stimulation of division. Lack of photoreceptors should also eliminate signalling that arises from differentiating photoreceptors and is required for morphogenetic furrow movement in the wild-type eye disc. Nevertheless, a remnant morphogenetic furrow is still observed in the atonal mutant disc. This presumably reflects the process of furrow initiation, which would not depend on signals from developing photoreceptors.},

	Abstract = {Neurogenesis is initiated by the transient expression of the highly conserved proneural proteins, bHLH transcriptional regulators. Here, we discover a conserved post-translational switch governing the duration of proneural protein activity that is required for proper neuronal development. Phosphorylation of a single Serine at the same position in Scute and Atonal proneural proteins governs the transition from active to inactive forms by regulating DNA binding. The equivalent Neurogenin2 Threonine also regulates DNA binding and proneural activity in the developing mammalian neocortex. Using genome editing in Drosophila, we show that Atonal outlives its mRNA but is inactivated by phosphorylation. Inhibiting the phosphorylation of the conserved proneural Serine causes quantitative changes in expression dynamics and target gene expression resulting in neuronal number and fate defects. Strikingly, even a subtle change from Serine to Threonine appears to shift the duration of Atonal activity in vivo, resulting in neuronal fate defects.},

	Abstract = {Skip to Next Section
Asymmetric cell divisions generate sibling cells of distinct fates (`A', `B') and constitute a fundamental mechanism that creates cell-type diversity in multicellular organisms. Antagonistic interactions between the Notch pathway and the intrinsic cell-fate determinant Numb appear to regulate asymmetric divisions in flies and vertebrates. During these divisions, productive Notch signaling requires sanpodo, which encodes a novel transmembrane protein. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila sanpodo plays a dual role to regulate Notch signaling during asymmetric divisions --- amplifying Notch signaling in the absence of Numb in the `A' daughter cell and inhibiting Notch signaling in the presence of Numb in the `B' daughter cell. In so doing, sanpodo ensures the asymmetry in Notch signaling levels necessary for the acquisition of distinct fates by the two daughter cells. These findings answer long-standing questions about the restricted ability of Numb and Sanpodo to inhibit and to promote, respectively, Notch signaling during asymmetric divisions.},

Within this group of cells, phyl expression thus mimics activation of the Raf pathway in its ability to induce photoreceptor rather than cone cell development.

	Abstract = {Cell differentiation and cell cycle exit are coordinately regulated during development; however, the molecular logic underlying this regulation is not known. The Drosophila cdk inhibitor Dacapo (Dap) is one of the key cell cycle regulators that exhibit dynamic expression during development and contribute to the developmental regulation of the cell cycle. In this study, regulation of Dap expression during cell type specification was investigated. The expression of Dap in the R2 and R5 precursors of the developing eye and in the newly recruited leg disc femoral sense organ precursors was found to be controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling-regulated transcription factor Pointed (Pnt) and the proneural basic helix-loop-helix proteins Atonal (Ato) and Daughterless (Da). We show that Pnt, Ato, and Da regulate Dap expression directly through their respective binding sites precisely at the time when these transcription factors function to specify neural fates. These results show that Dap expression is directly regulated by developmental mechanisms that simultaneously control cell type specification. This is potentially a general mechanism by which the expression of key cell cycle regulators is coordinated with differentiation during normal development. The direct regulation of key cell cycle regulators by the differentiation factors ensures coordinated regulation of cell cycle and differentiation.},

	Abstract = {The identification of untranslated regions, introns, and coding regions within an organism remains challenging. We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5\%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.},

@article{Luengo-Hendriks:2006aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To model and thoroughly understand animal transcription networks, it is essential to derive accurate spatial and temporal descriptions of developing gene expression patterns with cellular resolution.
RESULTS: Here we describe a suite of methods that provide the first quantitative three-dimensional description of gene expression and morphology at cellular resolution in whole embryos. A database containing information derived from 1,282 embryos is released that describes the mRNA expression of 22 genes at multiple time points in the Drosophila blastoderm. We demonstrate that our methods are sufficiently accurate to detect previously undescribed features of morphology and gene expression. The cellular blastoderm is shown to have an intricate morphology of nuclear density patterns and apical/basal displacements that correlate with later well-known morphological features. Pair rule gene expression stripes, generally considered to specify patterning only along the anterior/posterior body axis, are shown to have complex changes in stripe location, stripe curvature, and expression level along the dorsal/ventral axis. Pair rule genes are also found to not always maintain the same register to each other.
CONCLUSION: The application of these quantitative methods to other developmental systems will likely reveal many other previously unknown features and provide a more rigorous understanding of developmental regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {We have designed a system for targeted gene expression that allows the selective activation of any cloned gene in a wide variety of tissue- and cell-specific patterns. The gene encoding the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 is inserted randomly into the Drosophila genome to drive GAL4 expression from one of a diverse array of genomic enhancers. It is then possible to introduce a gene containing GAL4 binding sites within its promoter, to activate it in those cells where GAL4 is expressed, and to observe the effect of this directed misexpression on development. We have used GAL4-directed transcription to expand the domain of embryonic expression of the homeobox protein even-skipped. We show that even-skipped represses wingless and transforms cells that would normally secrete naked cuticle into denticle secreting cells. The GAL4 system can thus be used to study regulatory interactions during embryonic development. In adults, targeted expression can be used to generate dominant phenotypes for use in genetic screens. We have directed expression of an activated form of the Dras2 protein, resulting in dominant eye and wing defects that can be used in screens to identify other members of the Dras2 signal transduction pathway.},

@article{Wagner-Bernholz:1991aa,
	Abstract = {Localized expression of the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) in Drosophila melanogaster is required for normal development of the thoracic segments. When the Antp gene is expressed ectopically in the larval primordium of the antenna, the antennal imaginal disc, the developmental fate of the disc is switched and the adult antenna is transformed to a mesothoracic leg. We screened approximately 550 different fly strains carrying single copies of an enhancer-detector transposon to identify regulatory elements and corresponding genes that are either activated or repressed in antennal discs in response to this transformation. Several regulatory elements that are either direct or indirect targets of Antp were found. One transposant that expresses the reporter gene (lacZ) in the antennal disc, but not in the leg disc, was studied in more detail. The enhancer detector in this strain is located near a similarly regulated gene at the spalt (sal) locus, which encodes a homeotic function involved in embryonic head and tail development. The expression of this newly discovered gene, spalt major (salm) is strongly repressed in gain-of-function mutants that express Antp in the antennal disc. Recessive loss-of-function mutations (Antp-) have the opposite developmental effect; they cause the differentiation of antennal structures in the second leg disc. Accordingly, salm is derepressed in clones of homozygous Antp- cells. Therefore, we conclude that Antp negatively regulates salm. The time course of the interaction and reporter gene fusion experiments suggests (but does not prove) a direct interaction between Antp and cis-regulatory elements of salm. Our analysis of several enhancer-detector strains suggests that the basic patterning information in the antennal and leg imaginal discs is very similar.},

However, they do not give any information at the protein level, e.g., about the protein subcellular localization. Using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a mobile artificial exon carried by a transposable P-element, we have developed a protein trap system. We screened for individual flies, in which GFP tags full-length endogenous proteins expressed from their endogenous locus, allowing us to observe their cellular and subcellular distribution. GFP fusions are targeted to virtually any compartment of the cell. In the case of insertions in previously known genes, we observe that the subcellular localization of the fusion protein corresponds to the described distribution of the endogenous protein. The artificial GFP exon does not disturb upstream and downstream splicing events. Many insertions correspond to genes not predicted by the Drosophila Genome Project. Our results show the feasibility of a protein trap in Drosophila. GFP reveals in real time the dynamics of protein's distribution in the whole, live organism and provides useful markers for a number of cellular structures and compartments.},

	Abstract = {Atonal is a Drosophila proneural protein required for the proper formation of the R8 photoreceptor cell, the founding photoreceptor cell in the developing retina. Proper expression and refinement of the Atonal protein is essential for the proper formation of the Drosophila adult eye. In vertebrates, expression of transcription factors orthologous to Drosophila Atonal (MATH5/Atoh7, XATH5, and ATH5) and their progressive restriction are also involved in specifying the retinal ganglion cell, the founding neural cell type in the mammalian retina. Thus, identifying factors that are involved in regulating the expression of Atonal during development are important to fully understand how retinal neurogenesis is accomplished. We have performed a chemical mutagenesis screen for autosomal dominant enhancers of a loss-of-function atonal eye phenotype. We report here the identification of five genes required for proper Atonal expression, three of which are novel regulators of Atonal expression in the Drosophila retina. We characterize the role of the daughterless, kismet, and roughened eye genes on atonal transcriptional regulation in the developing retina and show that each gene regulates atonal transcription differently within the context of retinal development. Our results provide additional insights into the regulation of Atonal expression in the developing Drosophila retina.},

	Abstract = {Senseless (Sens) is a conserved transcription factor required for normal development of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system. In the Drosophila retina, sens is necessary and sufficient for differentiation of R8 photoreceptors and interommatidial bristles (IOBs). When Sens is expressed in undifferentiated cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow, ectopic IOBs are formed. This phenotype was used to identify new members of the sens pathway in a dominant modifier screen. Seven suppressor and three enhancer complementation groups were isolated. Three groups from the screen are the known genes Delta, lilliputian, and moleskin/DIM-7 (msk), while the remaining seven groups represent novel genes with previously undefined functions in neural development. The nuclear import gene msk was identified as a potent suppressor of the ectopic interommatidial bristle phenotype. In addition, msk mutant adult eyes are extremely disrupted with defects in multiple cell types. Reminiscent of the sens mutant phenotype, msk eyes demonstrate reductions in the number of R8 photoreceptors due to an R8 to R2,5 fate switch, providing genetic evidence that Msk is a component of the sens pathway. Interestingly, in msk tissue, the loss of R8 fate occurs earlier than with sens and suggests a previously unidentified stage of R8 development between atonal and sens.},

Cell clustering identified 87 initial cell clusters that are further subclustered and validated by targeted cell-sorting. Our data show high granularity and identify a wide range of cell types. Gene network analyses using SCENIC revealed regulatory heterogeneity linked to energy consumption. During aging, RNA content declines exponentially without affecting neuronal identity in old brains. This single-cell brain atlas covers nearly all cells in the normal brain and provides the tools to study cellular diversity alongside other Drosophila and mammalian single-cell datasets in our unique single-cell analysis platform: SCope (http://scope.aertslab.org).

	Abstract = {3D gene expression blueprint of the fly
When looking at populations of cells, features such as cell heterogeneity and localization are masked. However, single-cell sequencing reveals cellular heterogeneity and rare cell types. At the onset of gastrulation, the fly embryo consists of about 6000 cells with distinct gene expression profiles. Karaiskos et al. developed an algorithm to generate an interactive three-dimensional (3D) ``virtual embryo,'' with the expression of more than 8000 genes per cell measured for most cells (see the Perspective by Stadler and Eisen). The virtual embryo offers insights into developmental mechanisms---from local expression of regulators such as transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs to spatial modulation of signaling pathways.
Science, this issue p. 194; see also p. 172
By the onset of morphogenesis, Drosophila embryos consist of about 6000 cells that express distinct gene combinations. Here, we used single-cell sequencing of precisely staged embryos and devised DistMap, a computational mapping strategy to reconstruct the embryo and to predict spatial gene expression approaching single-cell resolution. We produced a virtual embryo with about 8000 expressed genes per cell. Our interactive Drosophila Virtual Expression eXplorer (DVEX) database generates three-dimensional virtual in situ hybridizations and computes gene expression gradients. We used DVEX to uncover patterned expression of transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs, as well as signaling pathway components. Spatial regulation of Hippo signaling during early embryogenesis suggests a mechanism for establishing asynchronous cell proliferation. Our approach is suitable to generate transcriptomic blueprints for other complex tissues.
Single-cell sequencing and an interactive database enable the generation of a 3D virtual fly embryo and a gene expression blueprint.

@article{Hicks:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.},

@article{Vaadia:2019aa,
	Abstract = {Proprioceptors provide feedback about body position that is essential for coordinated movement. Proprioceptive sensing of the position of rigid joints has been described in detail in several systems; however, it is not known how animals with a flexible skeleton encode their body positions. Understanding how diverse larval body positions are dynamically encoded requires knowledge of proprioceptor activity patterns in vivo during natural movement. Here we used high-speed volumetric swept confocally aligned planar excitation (SCAPE) microscopy in crawling Drosophila larvae to simultaneously track the position, deformation, and intracellular calcium activity of their multidendritic proprioceptors. Most proprioceptive neurons were found to activate during segment contraction, although one subtype was activated by extension. During cycles of segment contraction and extension, different proprioceptor types exhibited sequential activity, providing a continuum of position encoding during all phases of crawling. This sequential activity was related to the dynamics of each neuron's terminal processes, and could endow each proprioceptor with a specific role in monitoring different aspects of body-wall deformation. We demonstrate this deformation encoding both during progression of contraction waves during locomotion as well as during less stereotyped, asymmetric exploration behavior. Our results provide powerful new insights into the body-wide neuronal dynamics of the proprioceptive system in crawling Drosophila, and demonstrate the utility of our SCAPE microscopy approach for characterization of neural encoding throughout the nervous system of a freely behaving animal.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver of discoveries in the life sciences, with observable phenomena being limited by the optics of the microscope, the chemistry of the fluorophores, and the maximum photon exposure tolerated by the sample. These limits necessitate trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial resolution, light exposure, and imaging depth. In this work we show how content-aware image restoration based on deep learning extends the range of biological phenomena observable by microscopy. We demonstrate on eight concrete examples how microscopy images can be restored even if 60-fold fewer photons are used during acquisition, how near isotropic resolution can be achieved with up to tenfold under-sampling along the axial direction, and how tubular and granular structures smaller than the diffraction limit can be resolved at 20-times-higher frame rates compared to state-of-the-art methods. All developed image restoration methods are freely available as open source software in Python, FIJI, and KNIME.},

	Abstract = {The Drosophila genome contains {\textgreater}13000 protein-coding genes, the majority of which remain poorly investigated. Important reasons include the lack of antibodies or reporter constructs to visualise these proteins. Here, we present a genome-wide fosmid library of 10000 GFP-tagged clones, comprising tagged genes and most of their regulatory information. For 880 tagged proteins, we created transgenic lines, and for a total of 207 lines, we assessed protein expression and localisation in ovaries, embryos, pupae or adults by stainings and live imaging approaches. Importantly, we visualised many proteins at endogenous expression levels and found a large fraction of them localising to subcellular compartments. By applying genetic complementation tests, we estimate that about two-thirds of the tagged proteins are functional. Moreover, these tagged proteins enable interaction proteomics from developing pupae and adult flies. Taken together, this resource will boost systematic analysis of protein expression and localisation in various cellular and developmental contexts.},

	Abstract = {Faithful gene activity reporters are a useful tool for evo-devo studies enabling selective introduction of specific loci between species and assaying the activity of large gene regulatory sequences. The use of large genomic constructs such as BACs and fosmids provides an efficient platform for exploration of gene function under endogenous regulatory control. Despite their large size they can be easily engineered using in vivo homologous recombination in Escherichia coli (recombineering). We have previously demonstrated that the efficiency and fidelity of recombineering are sufficient to allow high-throughput transgene engineering in liquid culture, and have successfully applied this approach in several model systems. Here, we present a detailed protocol for recombineering of BAC/fosmid transgenes for expression of fluorescent or affinity tagged proteins in Drosophila under endogenous in vivo regulatory control. The tag coding sequence is seamlessly recombineered into the genomic region contained in the BAC/fosmid clone, which is then integrated into the fly genome using ϕC31 recombination. This protocol can be easily adapted to other recombineering projects.},

	Abstract = {The phiC31 integrase functions efficiently in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast, and mammalian cells, mediating unidirectional site-specific recombination between its attB and attP recognition sites. Here we show that this site-specific integration system also functions efficiently in Drosophila melanogaster in cultured cells and in embryos. Intramolecular recombination in S2 cells on transfected plasmid DNA carrying the attB and attP recognition sites occurred at a frequency of 47\%. In addition, several endogenous pseudo attP sites were identified in the fly genome that were recognized by the integrase and used as substrates for integration in S2 cells. Two lines of Drosophila were created by integrating an attP site into the genome with a P element. phiC31 integrase injected into embryos as mRNA functioned to promote integration of an attB-containing plasmid into the attP site, resulting in up to 55\% of fertile adults producing transgenic offspring. A total of 100\% of these progeny carried a precise integration event at the genomic attP site. These experiments demonstrate the potential for precise genetic engineering of the Drosophila genome with the phiC31 integrase system and will likely benefit research in Drosophila and other insects.},

The BAC is maintained at low copy number, facilitating plasmid maintenance and recombineering, but is induced to high copy number for plasmid isolation. Recombineering allows gap repair and mutagenesis in bacteria. Gap repair efficiently retrieves DNA fragments up to 133 kilobases long from P1 or BAC clones. PhiC31-mediated transgenesis integrates these large DNA fragments at specific sites in the genome, allowing the rescue of lethal mutations in the corresponding genes.

Generating mouse conditional knock-outs (cKO), where a gene can be eliminated in a temporally and spatially controlled manner, is a valuable technique because it allows study of gene function at any stage of life. In contrast and despite the development of many other powerful genetic tools, cKO has thus far been lacking in Drosophila. We combined several recent molecular and genetic technical advances in an approach termed integrase-mediated approach for gene knock-out (IMAGO). IMAGO allows the replacement of any genomic sequence, such as a gene, with another desired sequence, including cKO alleles that can be used to create positively marked mutant cells. IMAGO should also be applicable to other genetic model organisms.},

	Abstract = {Segmentation is the process of partitioning digital images into meaningful regions. The analysis of biological high content images often requires segmentation as a first step. We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.},

However, such approaches are limited by the requirement for processing and analyzing large sets of images., Results: Here, we describe Tools for Analysis of Nuclear Genome Organization (TANGO), an image analysis tool dedicated to the study of nuclear architecture. TANGO is a coherent framework allowing biologists to perform the complete analysis process of 3D fluorescence images by combining two environments: ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) for image processing and quantitative analysis and R (http://cran.r-project.org) for statistical processing of measurement results. It includes an intuitive user interface providing the means to precisely build a segmentation procedure and set-up analyses, without possessing programming skills.

This process is time-consuming and often a major bottleneck in the evaluation pipeline. To overcome this problem, we have introduced the Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS), a machine learning tool that leverages a limited number of manual annotations in order to train a classifier and segment the remaining data automatically. In addition, TWS can provide unsupervised segmentation learning schemes (clustering) and can be customized to employ user-designed image features or classifiers.

	Abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

	Abstract = {A procedure for forming hierarchical groups of mutually exclusive subsets, each of which has members that are maximally similar with respect to specified characteristics, is suggested for use in large-scale (n {\textgreater} 100) studies when a precise optimal solution for a specified number of groups is not practical. Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n − 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n − 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained. A general flowchart helpful in computer programming and a numerical example are included.},

@article{Perez-Lluch:2011aa,
	Abstract = {An important mechanism for gene regulation involves chromatin changes via histone modification. One such modification is histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), which requires histone methyltranferase complexes (HMT) containing the trithorax-group (trxG) protein ASH2. Mutations in ash2 cause a variety of pattern formation defects in the Drosophila wing. We have identified genome-wide binding of ASH2 in wing imaginal discs using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Our results show that genes with functions in development and transcriptional regulation are activated by ASH2 via H3K4 trimethylation in nearby nucleosomes. We have characterized the occupancy of phosphorylated forms of RNA Polymerase II and histone marks associated with activation and repression of transcription. ASH2 occupancy correlates with phosphorylated forms of RNA Polymerase II and histone activating marks in expressed genes. Additionally, RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation on serine 5 and H3K4me3 are reduced in ash2 mutants in comparison to wild-type flies. Finally, we have identified specific motifs associated with ASH2 binding in genes that are differentially expressed in ash2 mutants. Our data suggest that recruitment of the ASH2-containing HMT complexes is context specific and points to a function of ASH2 and H3K4me3 in transcriptional pausing control.},
